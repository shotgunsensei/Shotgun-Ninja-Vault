# Security Policy — Shotgun Ninja Vault

## Data Handling

### File Uploads

- All uploaded evidence files are hashed with **SHA-256** on ingestion.
- The hash is stored alongside the file record for integrity verification
  and deduplication (identical files are stored once).
- Upload size is capped by the `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` environment variable
  (default 25 MB).
- Files are validated server-side before storage. The storage layer uses a
  `StorageProvider` abstraction that writes to local disk today and is
  designed for future S3-compatible backends.

### Tokens and Keys

- **API tokens** are hashed with SHA-256 before storage. The plaintext
  token is shown exactly once at creation time and is never persisted or
  retrievable afterward.
- **License keys** are hashed with SHA-256 before storage. Validation
  requests compare incoming keys against stored hashes.
- **Session cookies** are signed with the `SESSION_SECRET`, and configured
  with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite=lax` attributes.

### Webhook Signatures

- Every outbound webhook delivery includes an **HMAC-SHA256** signature in
  the `X-Signature-256` header, computed over a timestamp and the JSON
  payload body.
- Receiving endpoints can verify authenticity by recomputing the signature
  using the shared secret displayed in the admin UI.

### Webhook SSRF Protection

- Webhook target URLs are validated at creation, update, and delivery time.
- URLs resolving to **localhost**, **RFC1918** (10.x, 172.16-31.x,
  192.168.x), **link-local** (169.254.x), or **IPv6 private** addresses
  (::1, fe80:, fc/fd, ::ffff:-mapped) are rejected.
- An **async DNS lookup** is performed to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
  where a hostname initially resolves to a public IP but later resolves to
  a private one.
- The `ALLOW_INTERNAL_WEBHOOKS=true` environment variable bypasses these
  checks for development and testing only.
- Outbound payloads are capped at **256 KB** and requests time out after
  **10 seconds**.

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

- Every database record is scoped by `tenantId`.
- All server-side queries include a tenant filter; cross-tenant access is
  not possible through the API.
- Role-based authorization is enforced at the route level with four tiers:
  OWNER, ADMIN, TECH, CLIENT.

---

## Transport and Headers

- The server sets `trust proxy` for correct behavior behind reverse proxies
  and load balancers.
- Security headers applied to all responses:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- A strict **Content Security Policy** is applied in production mode.

---

## Audit Trail

- All significant actions emit typed domain events via an internal event
  bus.
- An audit subscriber automatically logs every event with the acting user,
  tenant, entity type, entity ID, and event details.
- Audit logs are queryable and filterable in the admin UI.
